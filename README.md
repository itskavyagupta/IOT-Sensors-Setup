# iot-sensors-setup

The IoT firm has designed a master-slave architecture where multiple sensors are responding to a single master node. It means that even though these devices have different ID and storage capacity, all the data collected by them is going to a specific master node. The master node can be considered as a simple raspberry pi device. All the sensors that are forwarding data to a particular raspberry pi will have its information stored for the data forwarding. In the beginning the firm has not planned for load balancing. As the number of sensors/devices increased and the firm engineers kept on assigning the devices to a master/raspberry pi based on the maximum capacity, it creates a unique problem where some of the raspberry pi or master nodes are overloaded and some of them are under loaded.

Any master node will be considered as overloaded if it serves more than equal to n//2 devices in a particular environment. Consider a situation where 10 master nodes were placed on a floor that consisted of more than 100 devices. These 100 devices are sending data to these master nodes and mapped accordingly. If any master node is serving more than or equal to 50 sensors then only it will be considered overloaded and all these nodes are identified.
