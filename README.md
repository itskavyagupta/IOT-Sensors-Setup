**Project Title:** IoT Sensors Load Balancing

**Project Description:**
The IoT Sensors Load Balancing project addresses the challenge of managing master-slave architecture in IoT setups. As the number of sensors increases, some master nodes become overloaded while others remain underutilized. This project focuses on designing algorithms to identify overloaded master nodes using divide and conquer techniques. By leveraging lists and recursion, the project aims to find the majority master node in an IoT setup, optimizing data distribution and ensuring efficient system operation.
